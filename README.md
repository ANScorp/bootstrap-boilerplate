[index.html](index.html) is a HTML boilerplate file you can
use when starting a new project with Bootstrap.

It uses the official [Bootstrap CDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/)
so you don't have to worry about downloading anything.

Just create an index.html file in your new folder project, copy paste
ours and get started!
